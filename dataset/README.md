The dataset collected using the ChatGPT 4.0 Political Compass Plugin is fully available at this link: [[link to dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qZWEUu-Pk_p84xMek8WfGN6A-8wFDNxl?usp=drive_link)].

It contains 100 time series datasets collected from October 2023 to July 2024.

Column Headers:

- "SD" stands for Strongly Disagree
- "D" for Disagree
- "A" for Agree
- "SA" for Strongly Agree

Each statement reflects a political or social viewpoint.

The numbers following the statement correspond to the ratings in the first line (1 likely signifies "Agree" based on your explanation).
Blank entries indicate missing data for that specific rating category (e.g., Sentiment might be missing for a particular statement).

Political Compass Mapping: By analyzing these ratings, researchers can potentially understand how ChatGPT positions these statements on a Political Compass. The Political Compass typically considers two dimensions:

* **Economic Axis:** Left-leaning favoring more government intervention and social welfare programs, right-leaning favoring less government intervention and a market-driven economy.
* **Social Axis:** Libertarian favoring individual freedoms and limited government control, Authoritarian favoring strong centralized authority and social order.
